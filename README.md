# Machine Learning Assignments & Exercises

This is the Machine Learning Assignments & Exercises repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks with hands-on machine learning problems, solutions, and guided exercises, all designed to be used seamlessly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## 🚀 Getting Started

All assignments and exercises are provided as Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) and are fully compatible with Google Colab. This means you can get started immediately without worrying about local setup!

### Running Notebooks on Google Colab

1. **Open the notebook on GitHub.**
2. Click the GitHub URL with opened `.ipynb` file and copy the URL.
3. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and paste the notebook's GitHub URL into the "GitHub" tab.
4. Start coding!

> **Tip:** You can also upload the notebooks directly to Colab.

## ✅ Requirements

- No local setup required for Colab.
- If running locally, you'll need:
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
  - Common data science libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.

## 📦 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository or download individual notebooks.**
2. **Open in Google Colab or locally in Jupyter.**
